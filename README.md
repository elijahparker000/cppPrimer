This repo is to hopefully keep me on track with working through C++ Primer 5th Edition. There won't be anything groundbreaking, but hopefully I'll be proficient in c++ by the end of it. I'm doing this in lieu of classes this semester.
I definitely won't be doing every single exercise in the book, but I'll try to do anything I don't find trivial (which will probably be most of them).
